Description: Biologically Explainable Machine Learning Framework for Phenotype Prediction using omics data described in Chen and Schwarz (2017) <arXiv:1712.0036v1>.Identifying reproducible and interpretable biological patterns from high-dimensional omics data is a critical factor in understanding the risk mechanism of complex disease. As such, explainable machine learning can offer biological insight in addition to personalized risk scoring.In this process, a feature space of biological pathways will be generated, and the feature space can also be subsequently analyzed using WGCNA-based (Described in Horvath and Zhang (2005) <doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1128> and Langfelder and Horvath (2008) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-559> ) methods.
