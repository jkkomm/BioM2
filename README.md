<!-- Remove this note if you plan to copy this README -->

> **Note**: At present, the level of refinement in the details of this R package is suboptimal. Nonetheless, a series of novel functionalities are slated for inclusion to augment its capabilities.


## Motivation
Identifying reproducible and interpretable biological patterns from high-dimensional omics data is a critical factor in understanding the risk mechanism of complex disease. As such, explainable machine learning can offer biological insight in addition to personalized risk scoring.

## Deliverables
We have implemented a biologically informed multi-stage machine learning framework termed __BioMLF__ specifically for phenotype prediction using omics-scale data based on prior biological information including gene ontological (GO) and/or KEGG pathways.   

**Features of BioMLF in a nutshell**:   

1. Applicability for multiple omics data modalities (e.g. methylome, transcriptome). 
2. Various biological stratification strategies.    
3. Prioritizing outcome-associated functional patterns.   
4. Personalized scoring based on biological stratified patterns.   
5. Possibility for an extension to learning models of interest.

# Tutorial

<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

I believe that you should bring value to the reader as soon as possible. You should be able to get the user up and running with your project with minimal friction.

If you have a quickstart guide, this is where it should be.

Alternatively, you can add a demo to show what your project can do.

## Data requirements



## Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Next, you have to explain how to use your project. You can create subsections under here to explain more clearly.

## Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

> **Note**: For longer README files, I usually add a "Back to top" buttton as shown above. It makes it easy to navigate.

This is where your installation instructions go.

You can add snippets here that your readers can copy-paste with click:

```shell
gh repo clone navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme
```


# Contribute

You can use this section to highlight how people can contribute to your project.

You can add information on how they can open issues or how they can sponsor the project.

# License
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You can also mention what license the project uses. I usually add it like this:

[MIT license](./LICENSE)
